Again, again, again. SQL is mostly about table references, not columns. Make use of them. Donâ€™t be afraid of writing derived tables or other complex table references.
A derived table is nothing but a subquery wrapped in parentheses.

-- A derived table with an alias
FROM (SELECT * FROM author) a


-- Get authors' first and last names, and their age in days
SELECT first_name, last_name, age
FROM (
  SELECT first_name, last_name, current_date - date_of_birth age
  FROM author
)
-- If the age is greater than 10000 days
WHERE age > 10000
